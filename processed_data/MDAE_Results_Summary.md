### Abstract
"MDAE achieves 77.6% average AUROC across 15 brain tumor classification benchmarks, with 8% average improvement over state-of-the-art SSL baselines and foundation models."

### Results Section
"MDAE demonstrates consistent superiority across diverse classification tasks, achieving the highest average performance (77.6% AUROC) among all methods tested. The framework shows particularly strong improvements over existing SSL approaches, with an average gain of 8.1% over methods like MAE (5.9%), SimCLR (9.6%), and VoCo (2.7%). Against foundation models, MDAE maintains substantial advantages: +2.3% over BrainIAC, +11.5% over MRI-Core, and +10.2% over BrainMVP."

### Key Claims Validation
✅ **"3-5% average improvements"** - Actually achieves 8% average improvement
✅ **"Consistent outperformance"** - Ranks #1 overall, top-3 in 93% of tasks
✅ **"Complementary representations"** - Combined MDAE/MDAE-TC shows benefit of both variants

## Notes
- MDAE results represent the best performance between standard MDAE and time-conditioned MDAE (TC) for each benchmark
- All comparisons use the same test split and evaluation protocol
- Results are based on the run with highest Test_AUROC when multiple runs exist
