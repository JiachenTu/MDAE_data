# Multi-Modality Analysis Executive Summary

## Date: August 14, 2025

## Overview
We successfully extracted and analyzed data from 15 multi-modality benchmarks comparing the performance of MDAE and other methods when using multiple MRI modalities simultaneously versus single modalities.

## Data Extraction
- **Total Projects Analyzed**: 15 multi-modality WandB projects
- **Total Runs Extracted**: 680 runs across all benchmarks
- **Data Location**: `/raw_data/20250814_multi/`

## Key Findings

### Overall Performance
- **Average MDAE Improvement**: -0.35% (mixed results)
- **Positive Improvements**: 5 out of 15 benchmarks (33%)
- **Best Multi-Modality MDAE**: 100% AUROC (TCGA-GBM PFI 1-Year)

### Top 5 Improvements (Multi vs Single)
1. **TCGA-GBM PFI 1-Year**: +34.34% improvement (0.744 → 1.000 AUROC)
2. **UCSF-PDGM IDH Classification**: +14.34% improvement (0.813 → 0.930 AUROC)
3. **BraTS18 LGG vs HGG**: +9.81% improvement (0.841 → 0.924 AUROC)
4. **UPenn-GBM 2-Year Survival**: +3.96% improvement (0.650 → 0.676 AUROC)
5. **BraTS23 Meningioma vs Metastasis**: +0.49% improvement (0.965 → 0.970 AUROC)

### Notable Challenges
Some benchmarks showed decreased performance with multi-modality:
- **UPenn-GBM GTR Status**: -16.18% (0.609 → 0.510 AUROC)
- **RSNA-MICCAI MGMT**: -15.24% (0.643 → 0.545 AUROC)
- **UPenn-GBM Survival 18-Month**: -9.25% (0.695 → 0.630 AUROC)

### Modality Combinations
The analysis covered various modality combinations:
- **4-modality**: FLAIR + T1 + T1CE + T2 (most common)
- **6-modality**: T1 + T1C + T2 + FLAIR + SWI + ASL (UCSF-PDGM)
- **Consistent pattern**: T1 + T1GD + T2 + FLAIR for UPenn-GBM tasks

## Method Comparisons

### Best Performing Methods (Multi-Modality)
1. **MDAE**: Strong performance on most benchmarks
2. **MDAE (TC)**: Time-conditioned variant often outperforms standard MDAE
3. **MAE**: Competitive baseline, sometimes matching MDAE
4. **VoCo**: Strong on specific tasks (BraTS23)
5. **SwinUNETR**: Good performance on survival tasks

## Conclusions

1. **Task-Dependent Benefits**: Multi-modality significantly improves performance on certain tasks (TCGA-GBM PFI, UCSF-PDGM IDH) but not universally.

2. **Complexity Trade-off**: Some simpler tasks may not benefit from additional modalities and can even show degraded performance.

3. **MDAE Robustness**: MDAE maintains competitive performance in both single and multi-modality settings, often ranking in top 2 methods.

4. **Optimal Strategy**: The results suggest that modality selection should be task-specific rather than assuming "more is better."
