# Ablation Visualization Improvements Summary

## Date: August 14, 2025

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. FlowMDAE Parameter Grid (`flowmdae_parameter_grid_enhanced.png`)
✅ **Fixed Y-axis ordering**: Now correctly displays noise levels from 25% at bottom to 100% at top
✅ **Enhanced aesthetics**: 
   - Better color scheme (RdYlGn) with white grid lines
   - Bold annotations for better readability
   - Improved colorbar positioning
✅ **Data consistency**: Contour plot now uses exact same pivot table data as heatmap
✅ **Title updated**: "MDAE (Flow SDE) Parameter Grid - AUROC Performance"

### 2. Masking Ratio Analysis (`masking_ratio_analysis.png`)
✅ **Confidence interval explanation**: Added legend entry "95% Confidence Interval"
✅ **Improved clarity**: 
   - Shaded areas now clearly labeled as 95% CI
   - Better color consistency with line plots
   - Enhanced grid styling with dashed lines
✅ **Y-axis limits**: Set to [0.4, 0.9] for better scale

### 3. Masking Type Comparison (`masking_type_comparison.png`)
✅ **Single subplot design**: Removed violin plot, kept only bar chart
✅ **Reduced figure size**: Changed from (14, 6) to (8, 6) - standard proportion
✅ **Statistical annotation**: Added bracket with p-value directly on chart
✅ **Enhanced error bars**: Bolder styling for better visibility

### 4. Noise Corruption Analysis (UPenn Focus)
✅ **Dataset filtering**: Now shows only 7 UPenn benchmarks
✅ **Focused analysis**: 
   - 63 UPenn runs analyzed
   - Cleaner heatmap with relevant benchmarks only
   - Box plots specific to UPenn tasks

### 5. Overall Aesthetic Consistency
✅ **Standardized styling across all plots**:
   - Font sizes: Titles (14pt bold), Labels (12pt bold), Ticks (10pt)
   - Grid: alpha=0.3 with dashed lines where appropriate
   - Colors: Consistent palette usage
   - DPI: 300 for all outputs

## Files Updated
- `generate_ablation_visualizations.py` - Main visualization script with all improvements

## Files Generated (8 total)
1. `noise_corruption_grouped_bars.png` - UPenn-focused horizontal bars
2. `noise_corruption_heatmap.png` - UPenn benchmarks heatmap
3. `noise_corruption_boxplot.png` - Distribution by noise type
4. `masking_ratio_analysis.png` - Trends with 95% CI explanation
5. `masking_type_comparison.png` - Simplified single subplot
6. `flowmdae_parameter_grid_enhanced.png` - Fixed y-axis, better aesthetics
7. `flowmdae_contour_plot.png` - Consistent data with heatmap
8. `combined_summary.png` - Overview of all ablation types

## Key Changes to Address User Feedback

### Grey Areas Explained
The grey/shaded areas in the masking ratio plot represent **95% confidence intervals** calculated as:
```
CI = 1.96 × (standard deviation / √sample_size)
```
This shows the uncertainty around the mean performance for each benchmark.

### FlowMDAE Y-axis Fix
Previously: Y-axis was in ascending order (25, 50, 75, 100 from bottom to top)
Now: Correctly reversed for proper heatmap display using `sort_index(ascending=False)`

### Data Consistency
The contour plot now uses the exact same pivot table as the heatmap, ensuring complete data consistency between the two visualizations.

### Height Reduction
Masking type figure reduced from two subplots to one, maintaining all essential information while fitting standard display proportions.

## Result
All visualizations now have:
- Consistent, professional aesthetics
- Clear labeling and explanations
- Proper data representation
- Publication-ready quality at 300 DPI
